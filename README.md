# Pirate Intelligent Agent – Reinforcement Learning Project

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates the development of an intelligent pirate agent using reinforcement learning and neural networks. The goal of the agent is to navigate a maze environment efficiently while maximizing rewards and avoiding obstacles. This project showcases how machine learning techniques can be applied to decision-making problems and autonomous navigation.

## Project Work Summary

### Provided Code
The starter code included:
- The maze environment and game logic
- The pirate agent framework
- Functions for movement, rewards, and state tracking
- A basic neural network structure
- Training loop scaffolding

This provided the foundation for implementing reinforcement learning.

### Code I Implemented
I developed and completed key components, including:
- Q-learning logic for decision-making
- Neural network training to approximate Q-values
- Experience replay for improved learning stability
- Epsilon-greedy strategy to balance exploration and exploitation
- Training loop refinements for improved performance
- Evaluation of win rates and training progress

Through these additions, the pirate agent learned to navigate the maze successfully and improve its decision-making over time.

### How I Approach a Problem as a Computer Scientist
Working on this project strengthened my problem-solving approach:

1. **Understand the problem** – Analyze the maze environment and agent goals.  
2. **Break it into components** – State representation, rewards, training loop, and neural network.  
3. **Design a solution** – Apply reinforcement learning techniques.  
4. **Test and iterate** – Train the agent, evaluate performance, and refine parameters.  
5. **Optimize** – Improve learning efficiency and stability.

This structured approach helps ensure solutions are logical, scalable, and maintainable.

## Ethical Responsibilities

### Responsibilities to End Users
As developers of intelligent systems, we must ensure:
- Systems behave safely and predictably
- Decisions do not cause harm
- Outputs are reliable and tested

Even in a simulated environment like this project, these principles mirror real-world responsibilities when building AI systems.

### Responsibilities to Organizations
Developers must:
- Build secure and efficient systems
- Protect data integrity
- Ensure solutions align with organizational goals
- Maintain transparency in algorithm behavior

Reinforcement learning systems must be carefully tested to avoid unintended behaviors that could negatively impact users or business operations.
